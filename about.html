<p>Welcome to my project showcase. Name is Drew Colbert and I am here to share my coding journey. 
    I began coding a little over 3 years ago, and this site is the culmination of all the time, energy, frustration, and eventually perserverence of learning to code.
</p>

<p>I am proud to show off the work I have done, some of these projects are from when I first started in school, and I hope the progression is clear as you get to more recent projects. 
    I like to spend most of my time is R, but Python is the first one I learned and love using that too. A few of these projects will have a Shiny App associated with it, it will be linked inside of the post so be sure to look for those!</p>

<p>Please enjoy and thanks for visiting, feel free to reach out with any opportunities you may have for me!</p>
