# Hello World for Image Classification

This project was my first crack at image classification using TensorFlow and Keras to run a CNN to conduct image classification on the MNIST fashion dataset. I learned a bunch about neural networks in python and how to set them up, compile them, and then use them on a dataset. This specific notebook was made with the help of a tutorial, you will also find a version of this notebook that uses my own methods to classify each image without the use of tutorial. That notebook will be a better indictator of my own programming style. Nevertheless, this notebook provides insights to my journey with advanced deep learning algoithms. 

Instead of writing out my thoughts seperately, the code blocks themselves are commented with what I was thinking and the things I was learning along the way.
