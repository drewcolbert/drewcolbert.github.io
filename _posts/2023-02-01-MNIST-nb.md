# My take on Image Classification

During the time of this project, I had absolutely no experience withneural networks or with TensorFlow or any of that. <br>
So this is my orignial take on image classification using a multinomial naive bayes model. This was one of the first models I was introduced to, so that is why I chose that particular model. <br>
<br>

I am pretty proud of this one, as I did not have the benefit of using any tutorials to help guide me. This was me trying to figure everything out as I went along and I ended up getting a decent result at the end. If you read my previous post, you'll know that the CNN got an accuracy of about 90% (with little to no tuning of the model). Unsurprisingly, the neural network performs much better than the naive bayes model does. <br>

Similarly to the last post, I am not going to be writing my thoughts in between each code block because each code block is pretty well commented and documented (I think so anyways). 
<br>
<br>

Please enjoy my first self guided attempt at image classification!
